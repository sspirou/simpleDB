### Very simple in memory mock db table

motivated by a quick coding interview exercise 

- Implement a very simple SQL-ish in-memory db that validates type of insertions and keeps strings < 20 chars and ints in range -1024 to 1023.
- allow table retreival and removal from db by table name
- allow row insertion
- allow conditional row retreival 
- support table printing
